# SQL-NOSQL

This is the code for our SEG2102: DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS assignment titled: Performance Analysis of SQL vs NoSQL DBMS: A Comparative Study of Oracle Database and MongoDB

There are two real-world datasets we obtained from Kaggle and used in our assignment

Diabetes Dataset consists of approximately 100,000 records for large-scale performance evaluation.
StressLevel Dataset consists of approximately 1,000  records for baseline performance and integrity testing


SQL vs NoSQL Performance Comparison (Oracle APEX vs MongoDB)
This repository contains the full set of scripts and code used for the Database Management Systems Final Assessment. The project compares performance, scalability, and data integrity between a SQL-based system (Oracle APEX) and a NoSQL-based system (MongoDB).

🔍 Project Scope
The comparison focuses on:

Performance Benchmarks and Query Speed
Using two datasets from Kaggle:

StressLevel Dataset (~1,000 rows)
Diabetes Dataset (~100,000 rows)
CRUD operations (Insert, Update, Delete, Select) were executed in both Oracle and MongoDB, and latency was recorded.

Scalability Testing
The StressLevel dataset was cloned to scale from 1k → 10k → 50k → 100k rows. We evaluated how operation speed changes with growing data volumes.

Data Integrity and Consistency
We tested both databases using:

Insert with missing fields
Insert with wrong data types
Insert duplicate primary keys
Insert out-of-range values
Oracle enforced schema rules strictly; MongoDB was more flexible unless validation was enabled.
📊 Performance Testing Notes
Oracle scripts were tested using SQL Workshop in APEX.
MongoDB scripts were executed via Compass and pymongo.
Timing was recorded using built-in measurement tools and Python timestamps.
🧪 How to Use
Open the respective folder (oracle_apex or mongodb)
Load and run scripts in your environment
.sql files: Run in Oracle SQL Developer or APEX SQL Workshop
.js files: Use in MongoDB shell or Compass Script Editor
